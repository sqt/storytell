Join us at for a night of heart-felt amateur short-form storytelling.

## When is it?
Saturday, October 4th - 8:00 - 10:30PM

## Where is it?
```
The Simpson Home
28 Laurelhill Place
FK8 2JJ
```

## What is it?
Everyone has stories worth sharing... and everyone appreciates an engaging story! But how often are we able to take the time and really listen to the stories that others people have to share?
At *Storytell: "New Beginnings"* we'll carve out a bit of time and space to hear some of the true stories from other peoples' lives. And we'll do it with drinks, snacks, and a bit of socializing!

## Questions & Answers

### What kind of stories should I expect?
That's mostly up to the storyteller, but expect a story based on true events from that person's life, approximately 10 minutes long. For more information, see the section on "What's expected from a storyteller?"

### Will there be a common theme to the stories?
Yes. The stories will be _loosely_ tied to the theme of "New Begginnings"

### How many stories will there be?
We hope to have six storytellers, giving us about an hour's worth of stories in total. We'll have an intermission in the middle for snacks & chat.

### Is there an age limit?
Yes. We're limiting it to 13+, as some stories could potentially have mature themes.

### Can I be a storyteller?
Absolutely! Anyone can tell a story. Have a read through "What's expected from a storyteller?" and then send Tim a brief "pitch" for your story either via text, WhatsApp, or email. The (loose) theme of the evening will be "New Beginnings" so try to choose and/or frame your story idea accordingly. Tim will want to follow up for at least one "workshop" session with storytellers to make sure they're in good shape before the storytelling night.

### What's expected from a storyteller?
Storytellers are expected to stand up in front of a bunch of folks, some of whom they might not know, and tell a story based on true events from their own life. The story should be about 10 minutes in length and well-practiced enough to be told without notes in that time. See [Potential Storytellers]({{ "/storytellers/" | relative_url }}) for more information on telling stories. Storytellers are expected to be respectful of the audience's time and attention, just as the audience is expected to be respectful of the storyteller's time in preparation and willingness to share.

### What's expected of a listener?
Listeners are expected to sit and listen to the storytellers as they share their stories. Not all stories will be funny or sad or heartwarming, and not all storytellers will tell their stories with the same level of skill, but all the stories will be one that a storyteller thought worthwhile for the thought and effort required to practice telling. Listeners should be respectful of the storyteller's time in preparation and willingness to share, just as storytellers are expected to be respectful of the audience's time and attention.

## What is it?
Everyone has stories worth sharing... and everyone appreciates an engaging story! But how often are we able to take the time and really listen to the stories that others people have to share?
At *Storytell: "New Beginnings"* we'll carve out a bit of time and space to hear some of the true stories from other peoples' lives. And we'll do it with drinks, snacks, and a bit of socializing, of course!

## Good to Know

### Is there an age limit?
Yes. We're limiting it to 13+, as some stories could potentially have mature themes.

### What kind of stories should I expect?
That depends primarily on the storyteller, but expect a story based on true events from that person's life, approximately 10 minutes long. For more information, see the section on what's expected from a storyteller.

### Will there be a theme to the stories?
Yes. The stories will be loosely tied to the theme of "New Begginnings"

### How many stories will there be?
We hope to have six storytellers.

### Can I be a storyteller?
Absolutely! Anyone can tell a story. Have a read through "What's expected from a storyteller?" and then send Tim a brief "pitch" for your story either via text or email. The (loose) theme of the evening will be "New Beginnings" so try to choose and/or frame your story idea to match.

### What's expected from a storyteller?
Stand up and tell us a story, based on true events from your own life, roughly 10 minutes in length and well-practiced enough to be told without notes. Be respectful of the audience, as they are respecting you with their time and attention.

### What's expected of a listener?
Be respectful of the storytellers. They have taken time to think about and practice their stories in order to share them with you.

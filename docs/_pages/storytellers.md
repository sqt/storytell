## Examples
Here's a pretty good example of three slightly-too-short stories from the Moth Podcast (with a theme of Cycling): https://themoth.org/podcast/cycling (click "Listen Now" for their web player).

## Anecdotes vs Stories
It's not a universal distinction but, for the purposes of good storytelling, it's helpful to distinguish between anecdotes and stories:
- Anecdotes are simply a "thing that happened".
- Stories explain why the "thing that happened" was meaningful to the storyteller.

## Sharpening Questions
1) Was there a specific memory or moment that shifted something significant for you (e.g. the way you understood how people or families worked, how you understood yourself, the world, etc.)\
2) Is there something you hope the audience takes away from your story?\
3) If you had to distill your story into a "before" and "after" what might that be? (e.g. _Before_ I was afraid of something, _after_ I faced my fear; _Before_ I felt like an outsider, _after_ I felt a sense of connection)\
4) How might the events of your story have impacted you emotionally/mentally/physically/relationally?\
5) If you were constrained to focusing on only 2-3 moments in the story, what would they be?

## Plot Questions
Think about what kind of story you're telling. Is it a comedy? A tradegy? A drama? Does it have elements of romance? Suspense? Redemption?\
What is the shape of the plot of your story? Does it follow the typical plot outline of _exposition_, _conflict_, _climax_, and _resolution_? If not, why not?\
How does your story interact with time? Is it linear? Does it skip parts? Does it ever go backwards? Could it? Should it?\
What effect does breaking typical storytelling conventions have on the listener?

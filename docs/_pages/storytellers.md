## Examples
Here's a pretty good example of three slightly-too-short stories from the Moth Podcast (with a theme of Cycling): https://themoth.org/podcast/cycling (click "Listen Now" for their web player).

## Anecdotes vs Stories
It's not a universal distinction by any means, but for the purposes of good storytelling I would differentiate between anecdotes and stories in the following way:
- Anecdotes are simply a "thing that happened", eg. "I was yelled at by Michael Douglas on the set of Wonder Boys."
- Stories explain why the "thing that happened" was meaningful to the storyteller, eg. "I was having a really bad day and then was roped into babysiting some drunken friends as they wandered all over Carnegie Mellon University's campus. When they were being too loud near the night-time filming of Wonder Boys, Michael Douglas came out from behind a tent and yelled at us for making too much noise. The absurdity of the situation made me laugh and helped me to realize things weren't so bad after all. So thanks for yelling at me, Michael Douglas!"

## Sharpening Questions
1) Was there a specific memory or moment that shifted something significant for you (the way you understood how people or families worked, how you understood yourself, the world, etc.)
2) Is there something you hope the audience walks away with from your story?
3) If you had to distill your story into a “before” and “after,” what might that be? (Ex. “Before” I was afraid of something, “after” I faced my fear. “Before” I felt like an outsider, “after” I felt a sense of connection,” etc.)
4) How might the events of your story have impacted you emotionally/mentally/physically/relationally?
5) If you were constrained to focusing on only 2-3 moments in the story, what would they be?

## Plot Questions
Think about what kind of story you're telling. Is it a comedy? A tradegy? A drama? Does it have elements of romance? Suspense? Redemption? What is the shape of the plot of your story? Does it follow the "typical" plot outline of "exposition", "conflict", "climax", "resolution"? If not, why not? How does your story interact with time? Is it told linearly? Does it skip parts? Does it ever go backwards? Could it? Should it? What effect does "breaking" typical storytelling conventions have on the listener?
